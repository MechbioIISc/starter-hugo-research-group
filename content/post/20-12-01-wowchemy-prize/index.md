In pathological situations, cancer is a mass of over-proliferating cells growing in the space of our host epithelial tissues. In Epithelia, elimination of oncogenic cells via cell competition is a defence mechanism against cancer- Epithelial defence against cancer (EDAC). How is EDAC impaired and how do cancer cells gain the competitive advantage over host epithelial tissues? Can we generate novel anticancer therapies which enhance our bodyâ€™s defence mechanism against cancer?
