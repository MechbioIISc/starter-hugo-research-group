Aging is considered as a pro-tumorigenic state and constitutes the single most important risk factor for cancer development. The causative relation between ageing and cancer is majorly considered to be the accumulation of oncogenic mutations over long period of time. However, an alternative, but not mutually exclusive hypothesis is possible i.e. aging influence the overall tissue mechanics and subsequently impair our tissueâ€™s defence mechanism against cancer.
