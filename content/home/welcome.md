**Who  we are**

We are a team of multidisciplinary researchers interested in understanding biological systems using tools from applied cell-biology, bioengineering and soft matter physics. Primarily, we study mechanics and biology of epithelial tissues in the context of cancer.

**What we do**

We use experimental techniques such as gene editing, high resolution live cell imaging, traction force microscopy and reflection interference contrast microscopy, in tandem with concepts from soft matter physics to obtain a Bio-physical understanding of EDAC. To make sense of our experiments, we complement them with computational tools such as automated cell segmentation and cell tracking.
