During my PhD, I studied the role of physical forces along with biological pathways in collective cell migration. I found that biological systems are not driven only by bio-chemical reactions but also by physical forces and its environment. Therefore, studying only one pathway will reveal only one side of the coin. Hence I decided to study biosystems with a multidisciplinary approach. If you are interested in sharing your experiences of working with complex biological systems, or you are looking for a collaboration, or just want to have a chat about research, please get in touch.
